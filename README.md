# Generative AI Web Application with Voice-to-Text Integration

I built a Generative AI-powered web application using Google Gemini API that allows users to generate high-quality, clean, and structured content. The application provides a beautiful and user-friendly frontend where users can enter prompts and receive well-formatted AI-generated outputs.

# Key Features:

1. AI Content Generation – Uses Google Gemini model to generate detailed and insightful responses.
2. Voice-to-Text Input – Users can speak their queries instead of typing, enabling hands-free interaction.
3. Clean Output Formatting – Ensures the generated content is structured with headings, bullet points, and emphasis for better readability.
4. Interactive Web Interface – Built with Flask (Python backend) and HTML/CSS (frontend) for smooth user experience.


# Tech Stack:

1. Backend: Python, Flask
2. Frontend: HTML, CSS
3. APIs: Google Gemini AI (Generative Content)
4. Libraries: SpeechRecognition (voice-to-text), Flask, Requests

# Impact:
This project demonstrates how Generative AI and Speech Recognition can be combined to build intelligent, user-friendly applications for content creation, productivity, and accessibility.
